    You are an AI assistant tasked with extracting specific information from a resume. The resume text is provided below, and you are required to find the following fields and provide the details in a structured JSON format. If a field is not found, respond with "Not found" for that field. Please make sure that the output strictly follows the required fields. Do not include any extra information or fields. Ensure that the values are populated correctly, and there are no duplicates or missing fields.

    Here are the fields:

        1) Full Name: The name is usually at the top of the resume and may be formatted in bold or larger text. It is often followed by contact information such as an email or phone number. Look for words that are proper nouns (capitalized) and exclude titles like 'Mr.', 'Ms.', etc.

        2) Contact details (Email, Phone Number): Find the email address and phone number as they appear in the resume.

        3) University/College: Look for the educational institution name, typically found in the 'Education' or 'Academic Background' section.

        4) Year of Study: This can be a date range (e.g., 2018-2022) or a single year if the person is currently studying.

        5) Course/Program: The name of the course or program being pursued.

        6) Discipline/Major: The field of study or specialization.

        7) CGPA/Percentage: Academic score, typically labeled as 'CGPA' or 'GPA', or percentage.

        8) Key Skills: Any specific skills mentioned in the resume. Look for sections labeled 'Skills' or 'Core Competencies'.

        9) Gen AI Experience Score: Provide a score based on experience mentioned in Gen AI. The score should be on a scale from 1 to 3, where:
            - 1 means Exposed (has knowledge or exposure to Gen AI concepts but no hands-on experience).
            - 2 means Hands-on (has worked on Gen AI projects but without advanced techniques).
            - 3 means Advanced (has worked on advanced areas of Gen AI such as Agentic RAG, Evals, etc.).

        10) AI/ML Experience Score: Provide a score based on experience mentioned in AI or Machine Learning. The score should be on a scale from 1 to 3, where:
            - 1 means Exposed (has knowledge or exposure to AI/ML concepts but no hands-on experience).
            - 2 means Hands-on (has worked on AI/ML projects but without advanced techniques).
            - 3 means Advanced (has worked on advanced areas of AI/ML such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, etc.).

        11) Supporting Information (Certifications, Internships, Projects): Any certifications, internships, or projects relevant to the field.

        **Important Notes**:
        - The values for each field must be **accurate** and **appear only once**.
        - If a field does not exist in the resume, return **"Not found"** for that field.
        - Make sure there are **no duplicates**
        - Do not include any unnecessary fields or information. Only return the required fields in the format specified below:

        Return the result in **valid JSON format** only. Do not include any extra text or explanations.

        Extract the information only from this resume content:
        "{resume_text}"
